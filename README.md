# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
   
   - User needs that were addressed in the design of this app is tracking items using a database and having a mechanism which can change the number of items in an inventory. The home screen and the updating of items in an inventorywere crucial for the user to have access to. These helped them because it allowed them to use the app to their fullest capacity.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
   
    - My approach to the process of coding my app was a long process which took a lot of effort. I first layed out my foundation of what was going to be included in my app then I started the development proccess and debugged my app. These methods could be applied in the future just in case I have to do another project similar to this one.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    
    - I accomplished this by making sure every line of code was correct because even a small grammatical error makes the code not run so I had to double check, sometimes even triple check to ensure the input was correct to result in the output that was expected. This process is important because it allows users to see what went wrong in their code if there's ever an error and it revealed that there won't be an output if the input is invalid.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
   
   - A big hurdle was developing the code, I really had to resort to self teaching myself at times because the course maaterial either confused me even more or it wasn't helpful in what I was trying to accomplish.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
   
   - This part would be designing the app. I consider myself somewhat artistic so it wasn't that difficult for me to come up with a design layout.
